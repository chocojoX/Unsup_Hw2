# Unsup_Hw2
Homework 2 for Unsupervised learning


To run the code, please download the following packages :
- munkres
- sklearn
- scipy
- numpy

When these packages are available, you should create a folder called _data_ in the project root. Files _ExtendedYaleB.mat_ and the folder _Hopkins155_ should be added to this directory.
Note that the _data_ folder will also contain the so called _distance matrix_ containing euclidean distance between all images. This is done to ensure that this distance is computed once and for all, which can lead to a great gain of time.
